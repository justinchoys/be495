HMR Sorry Board Game - BE495/496 - UPenn Bioengineering 2015

This is an arduino program designed to simulate the Sorry! boardgame using 1 'master' control board that signals 4 'slave' Sparki robots to move on a board via programmed Bluetooth instructions.
The 'master' control board is also responsible for updating the 'monitor 1' and 'monitor 2' to display apprioriate text that describes what each player rolled during his/her turn and what is happened at each turn (e.g. which player is rolling the dice, which player won, etc)
A final paper detailing the motivation behind the development of this game system as well as the process of testing and improving the product over the course of two semesters is included in the 'W5Final paper.pdf' file.
